#In this SQL, I am using queries to extract statistical information about customer and order data from a database that contains multiple tables. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT DISTINCT Customers.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales AS February
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.customers AS Customers
ON February.orderID = Customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT Product, Price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Price IN (SELECT MIN(Price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) * Price AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), SUM(Quantity) * Price AS Total_Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT cust.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS cust
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS feb
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID
WHERE feb.quantity > 2
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT Product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;

#9. Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?
SELECT DISTINCT location, COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%NY%'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location
HAVING COUNT(orderID) > 2;
